'''Python Program for n-th Fibonacci number
In mathematical terms,
 the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers
  is defined by the recurrence relation
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
with seed values

# #program4 - using dynamic programming
# '''Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion.
# Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs,
# we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.
# The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems,
# so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later.
# This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
# For example, if we write simple recursive solution for Fibonacci Numbers,
# we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by storing solutions of subproblems,
# time complexity reduces to linear'''
