'''Python program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval
Given two positive integer start and end.
The task is to write a Python program toprint all Prime numbers in an Interval.

Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1
 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
 The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.
The idea to solve this problem is to iterate the val from start to end using
a for loop and for every number, if it is greater than 1,
 check if it divides n. If we find any other number which divides,
 print that value.'''
